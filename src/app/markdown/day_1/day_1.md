## Introduction to Alexa

### What is Alexa?

When it comes down to it, Alexa is simply a headless browser with microphones and a speaker assembly. 

Because the device is essentially a browser, developers like you and me have the ability to write small 
scripts that can be ran from external services.

### Objectives of the Class

Your challenge, if you choose to accept...

* Expose students to the fundamentals of developing skills for Alexa.
* Give students the tools to build consumable Skills and publish them on the [Alexa Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html)

## Installing Virtual Box and Vagrant

### Why Vagrant?

The main reason we are using Virtualbox is because it will act as a equal playing field for everyone. 
It will also act like AWS if you plan on developing other apps or services.

Using Virtual Box might take a little while to get used to if you are used to a windows environment, 
but it is very rewarding.

* Visit [this link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to download Virtual Box.
* You will need to install Vagrant, so you can get access to some cool tools, download it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* Once this is installed you will need to clone a git repo that has the tools we will use [here](https://github.com/lennycartier/nodejs-vagrantbox)
